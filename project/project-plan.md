## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Project 1 - Road Accident Data Cologne
Explore road safety by looking at a big dataset about accidents. We want to figure out why accidents happen and how bad they can get. By using the data, we can predict what all factors can cause accidents. This is not just a project; it's a chance to make roads safer by understanding what causes accidents.

Project 2 - Bicycle Traffic Data Cologne
This project describes the long term bicycle traffic trends such as, has there been an overall increase or decrease in bicycle traffic volume in Cologne over the years?
This analysis can provide insights into popular cycling routes and intersections, helping planners identify areas where additional safety measures, such as dedicated bike lanes or traffic calming measures, are necessary.
